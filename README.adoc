This is a course on game development created in 2014.

== Background

I ran a game company for a number of years.
Fun and exciting stuff, but a hard business to be in.
One of the products we developed was this course on web game development.
There were supposed to be a number of videos to go with the course modules.
We had a script, did some shooting, but ended up canceling the project.
(The ROI did not justify all the expenses.)

== The Course

The course walks through how to make a match-3 game that runs in a web browser.
View the docs/index.html page in a web browser to start the course.

This course is not completely polished.
I hope that what is here can help people learn about game development.
